    Valley River Water Trail flows through peaceful landscapes, quiet meanders,

    including two historic covered bridges. Wildlife is plentiful along the
    entire waterway. The region is rich in social, cultural, and historical
    heritage. There are a few short sections of Class I/II water for more
    experienced paddlers to explore. The trail begins near the community of Sago
