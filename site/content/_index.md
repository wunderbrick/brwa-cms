  heading: About the Trail
  text: >-
    The proposed Water Trail is 45 miles originating near the community of Sago
    in Upshur County and ending near the Arden community in Barbour County. The
    trail is mostly flatwater with occasional riffles, offering excellent
    beginner and family friendly routes. 


    The proposed Water Trail flows through peaceful landscapes, quiet meanders, and mature forested landscapes, as well as communities rich in history, including two historic covered bridges. Wildlife is plentiful along the entire waterway, with herons, beavers, and bald eagles among the highlights. There are a few short sections of Class I/II water for more experienced paddlers to explore.

    groundhog, muskrat, and foxes. Fishing opportunities are also plentiful. The
    region is rich in social, cultural, and historical heritage."
